Retail Business Performance & Profitability Analysis
Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing retail sales data to uncover hidden business insights.
The goal is to identify profit-draining categories, improve inventory management, and spot seasonal sales patterns.
By combining SQL, Python, and Power BI, I created a complete analytics workflow — from raw data cleaning to business-ready dashboards.

Tools & Technologies
SQL → Data cleaning, aggregation queries, profitability calculations
Python (Pandas, Matplotlib) → Exploratory data analysis, trend analysis, visualizations
Power BI → Interactive dashboard with KPIs, category & regional insights
Excel → Supporting calculations and dataset checks

Key Insights
Office Supplies drove the highest sales, while Furniture provided better profit margins.
Sales spiked in Q4, highlighting strong seasonal behavior.
Discounts negatively impacted profit in multiple sub-categories.
The East region emerged as the most profitable market.
